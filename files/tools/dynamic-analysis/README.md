# What?

Dynamic analysis is the code analysis that could only be done during program run. This also means that it can
only be done when program is already compiled, so as a consequence error detected by this kind of analysis is more intricate. When performing the test launch program can be executed on both real and virtual processor.

# Why?

Because when we write our code, we do care about bugs. So there are tools that help us to find and  fix them automatically at late stages.

Dynamic analysis is often performed in an effort to uncover subtle defects or vulnerabilities. The principal advantage of dynamic analysis is the fact that it can reveal errors that do not manifest themselves until a disaster occurs weeks, months or years after release. 

# Also

Nevertheless, dynamic analysis may be the second step in a comprehensive software quality-control regime. Before dynamic analysis has been done we may use static analysis to reveal errors on early stages. In computer terminology, static means fixed, while dynamic means capable of action and/or change. Dynamic analysis involves the testing and evaluation of a program based on execution. Static and dynamic analysis, considered together, are sometimes referred to as glass-box testing.
