# About
It is a collection of useful c++ development tools, and resources to learn them. 

# Why?

Generally speaking it will be used as a reference for everyone who asks [me](https://github.com/B1Z0N) about this things. Also i was wondering if it is being taught in universities. So I asked a lot of developers in chats and fiends of mine, most answers was "NO". They also told me that they wish universities do cover this topics. So this is my answer to them.

# What?

This repository is intended to cover:

1. Simple description of C++ language for beginners.
2. Useful resources to learn C++, for developers of different levels.
3. Major general-use C++ related tools (general description, and resources to learn).
4. Some author's thoughts about the way of c++ developer.

# How?

**ALMOST ALL OF THE RESOURCES WAS CONTRIBUTED TO/READ/TESTED BY MAINTAINERS(OR BY CONTRIBUTORS) OF THIS REPO**

1. If you are a **beginner** in programming, or **in doubt** about learning C++, check [this](C++/ABOUTcpp.md) out.

2. If you just want to learn from masters, then [here](C++/cppRES.md) are **THE LIST OF C++ RESOURCES**.

3. If you want to have some practice, [here is](C++/cppREPOS.md) the list of repos to contribute to. You can start contributing from now, or after learning C++ tools in the next item.

4. And finally, if you have some background in cppdev and you want to enhance the ability to organize your project, speed up development, learn best development process practices. You should definitely look in [here](tools/README.md), because this is **THE LIST OF USEFUL C++ TOOLS RESOURCES**.

5. [Afterword](etc/afterword.md)
