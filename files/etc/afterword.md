# Afterword

Way of C++ developer is not an ordinary programmer way at all. This is one of rare programming languages aimed at performance and elegance but popular at the same time. So during reading of this repository you've learned a lot about C++, and ready to go and get a solid job in this field.  Or if you want, you can just start your project, I call this `The art of programming`. Or you could do something else. The choice is yours.



Does not matter what path you'll choose. The only thing that matters is that you should **have fun** working with it. And I wish you can call this not "work" in ordinary sense of this word, but "my art". 

I won't tell you to write quality software, after reading all this, you can't write totally "bad" code. Even if you write good software from nowadays perspective, all modern rules was developed by someone, so I'm not sure it will be that "good" in the future. 

Despite this seemingly sad words i encourage YOU to **think yourself**! Think yourself, but **learn from others**;) So here is the summary:

1. Have fun developing art
2. Think yourself, but learn from others

# Topics not (aimed to be) covered, but useful

1. Unix and bash scripting
2. Assembly language
3. Algorithms and data structures
