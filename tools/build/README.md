# What?

**Build system** is a tool that is used for **build automation**. The later one involves scripting the process of compiling source code into binary code.

# Why?

While the project is small it is easy to type all the commands to compile it(for example `g++ source.cpp -o executable`). But when it comes to large or medium projects the common practice is to automate this process, in order to save a lot of time. No need to type all commands, just type command for project compilation that will invoke build system script which will do all the work for you. This saves time, you type all command first time in script and then edit it when needed.
