# [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)
is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. It provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and 
focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. The goal is to detect 
only real errors in the code (i.e. have very few false positives).
