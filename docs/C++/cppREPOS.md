# About

After learning at least basics of C++ you should start practicing actively, and soon you'll see the result. 
Start reading other repositories, reading code of others is a great experience, so do your best.
And **this item** aimed at helping you to find such repositories. 
But remember that during work, code of others could be not as good as in the repos from next item.

# Repositories
Reading others code is very important, but not so easy to start. So I sorted repos by complexity, so that you get used to it.

## Beginner
- [Algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/faheel/Algos)
- [Bigint](https://github.com/faheel/BigInt)
## Intermediate
- [Guidlines support library](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)
-
### Advanced

# Okay! What's next?
Now you are ready to start learning [C++ tools](../tools/README.md) or if you already done, it's time to [afterword](../etc/afterword.md).
