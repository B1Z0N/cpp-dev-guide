# What?

Static analysis, also called static code analysis, is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program. The process provides an understanding of the code structure, and can help to ensure that the code adheres to industry standards. Automated tools can assist programmers and developers in carrying out static analysis. The process of scrutinizing code by visual inspection alone (by looking at a printout, for example), without the assistance of automated tools, is sometimes called program understanding or program comprehension.

# Why?

Because when we write our code, we do care about bugs. So there are tools that help us to find and  fix them automatically at early stages.

The principal advantage of static analysis is the fact that it can reveal errors that do not manifest themselves until a disaster occurs weeks, months or years after release. 

# Also

Nevertheless, static analysis is only a first step in a comprehensive software quality-control regime. After static analysis has been done, dynamic analysis is often performed in an effort to uncover subtle defects or vulnerabilities. In computer terminology, static means fixed, while dynamic means capable of action and/or change. Dynamic analysis involves the testing and evaluation of a program based on execution. Static and dynamic analysis, considered together, are sometimes referred to as glass-box testing.
