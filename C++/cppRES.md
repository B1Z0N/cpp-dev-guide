# About
This section covers resources for learning C++ in general, and few specific topics of C++ programming. First of all you
should understand that it is not complete list, and it never aimed to be complete. Just a compilation of books, that with
proper practice will lead you to great developer skills.

# C
C is an important and initial subset of C++. It would be much better to learn it first, but you could of course skip this
part.
## Books
- Head First C - David Griffiths and Dawn Griffiths

    Perfect book for beginners, written in very easy-to-read and intersting maner.
    
- The C Programming Language - Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

    Book written by creators of C. This is the definitive guide, for those who wish to learn C. I found examples very helpful
    too.
# C++
## Books
### Beginner
- Principles and Practice Using C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup

    Introduction to programming by C++ creator.
    
- The C++ Programming Language - Bjarne Stroustrup

    Complete C++ language reference and tutorial. This book will teach you how to use C++ features correctly, as inteded by
    creator. Though it is very long to read, (around 13 hundreds of pages) it is very simply writen. During reading this 
    book practice is welcomed and encouraged, since it is more of a reference.
### Intermediate
All books of Scott Meyers are very useful in practice. He teaches that programming is about compromises, and that we must
search for different methods of problem solving, so take this:
- Effective C++ - Scott Meyers
- More Effective C++ - Scott Meyers
- Effective STL - Scott Meyers
- Effective Modern C++ - Scott Meyers
If you don't have enough time, just read first book, it would be enough for the beginning.
### Specific topics
Intermediate programmer should learn specific topics of the language(which are themselves quite deep) before moving on to
advanced.
